                <h2>The Owyhee</h2>
                <p>Crews built The Owyhee Hotel in 1910 on the corner of Main St. and 11th St. It served hotel customers
                    for 112 years, until the conversion and remodel in 2013 added additional office space and 36
                    apartments.The company adds The Owyhee to its growing Boise portfolio, which includes the newer
                    portions of the
                    BoDo development, and The Jefferson Condos.</p>

                <h2>Boise Theater</h2>
                <p class="home-paragraph-2">It was a popular pastime to ride the entire loop on a Sunday afternoon,
                    according to the historical society. A rail car window could frame scenes of burgeoning urban cities
                    like Caldwell and Boise as well as the sage brush country of southwest Idaho. In May 1928, service
                    on the electric line stopped. Intercity tracks were dismantled. Other tracks were paved over and
                    forgotten.</p>

                <h2>Downtown Boise is booming</h2>
                <p class="home-paragraph-3">Boise has always commanded a somewhat unique reputation among the denizens
                    of the Gem State. Boise still seems
                    to carry many of the trappings that come with rural living. It’s a place where a vibrant downtown
                    packed with fusion restaurants and novelty shops seems only a stone’s throw away from cattle
                    crossings and horse trails.</p>

                <h2>Boise Idaho</h2>
                <p class="home-paragraph-4">Boise is currently the 15th fastest growing city in the United States,
                    according to Forbes. The Boise City-Nampa metropolitan area is growing at a rate of 1.7% per year
                    with a job growth rate that is keeping up. The largest cities in Idaho, including Boise, are rising
                    about three times faster than smaller towns in the state..</p>
